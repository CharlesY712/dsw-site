Hello!

Congratulations! Your session "<%= @submission.title %>" has been selected to be part of the <%= @submission.track.name %> Track during Denver Startup Week.

We are currently working on assigning locations and times based on schedule availability, track locality, and expected attendance. We try to schedule related talks in nearby venues, though we are unable to guarantee specific placement. That process will be complete within a few weeks, and we will be reaching out with additional details as they are finalized.

As a session organizer, you will have a 90 minute slot available to fill as you see fit. You are not, however, required to fill the entire allotted time. We will work with you to make sure that you understand everything involved in putting a session together, and provide logistical support during the event.

Please reply back as soon as possible to confirm that you are still willing and able to host this session. We will be in touch with you over the next couple of weeks with additional details, including scheduling.

Thank you for participating in Denver Startup Week! Please let us know if we can answer any questions.

Thanks,

<%= @submission.track.chairs.map(&:name) * ' & ' %>
