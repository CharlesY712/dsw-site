Hello!

Thank you for submitting a session for consideration for Denver Startup Week!

We had an unprecedented number of high-quality submissions this year, which is tremendously exciting. Unfortunately, it also means that we could not select all of the events for inclusion in the Denver Startup Week schedule.

Your session "<%= @submission.title %>" has been waitlisted for inclusion in the 2015 Denver Startup Week program. This means that we do not currently have a place for it. However, as the schedule solidifies over the course of the next few weeks, an opening may become available. We will be in touch with a definitive answer no later than September 1.

If you are no longer interested and would like to remove your session from consideration, please email us at info@denverstartupweek.org.

Thank you again for supporting the Denver startup community!

Sincerely,

The Denver Startup Week Planning Committee
