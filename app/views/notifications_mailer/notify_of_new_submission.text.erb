Hey there,

A new submission has been proposed for the <%= @track.name %> track:

<%= @submission.title %>

<%= @submission.description %>

Submitter's notes:

<%= @submission.notes %>

It's proposed as a <%= @submission.format %>, to be held <%= @submission.day %> in the <%= @submission.time_range %> slot, at <%= @submission.location %>. Size is estimated to be <%= @submission.estimated_size %>.

It was submitted by <%= @submission.submitter.name %> (<%= @submission.contact_email %>).

Cheers,
