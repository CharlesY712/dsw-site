Hey there,

We wanted to take a moment to thank you for dedicating your knowledge, time, and resources to organize and/or host one of the 370 sessions at the sixth annual Denver Startup Week! This event would not happen without you and we are incredibly grateful for all of the support and hard work you put in to make it a success.

This year’s event broke records on a number of fronts. A few exciting highlights:

18,900 registered attendees (a 42% increase from last year’s attendance)

99+ million social media impressions on #DENStartupWeek (a 104% increase from 2016)

50,000 unique users on the DSW website

850,000+ distinct pageviews on the DSW website

As we begin to collect and organize the numerous stories and outcomes from the week, we will compile a comprehensive follow-up to share with you.  We also encourage you to share your stories, pictures and videos with us.


We have a couple of final housekeeping items for you before we put DSW 2015 in the books:

1) SLIDES/VIDEOS

We have received many requests from attendees for slides and/or videos of sessions. If you have either and would be willing to share them, please drop us a line. We have a section of the website to aggregate these and would love to include your materials.

2) SIGNS & EASELS

If you ended up with spare easels at the end of the week, please let us know. We will happily come by and pick them up for reuse next year. Or, if you would rather drop them off, please do so at the Downtown Denver Partnership office located at 1515 Arapahoe Street, Tower 2, Suite 400.

Unfortunately we’re not able to reuse sign posters across years, so if you have those left over, feel free to dispose of them.

3) PHOTOS

If you or your team took photos during the week, we would love to see them! We have created a Google Drive folder where you can upload any photos taken during the week. Please create a new folder and add your session name to it so that we can organize all of the images. The folder can be accessed at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0YgZBdQZ9KBYUNTZ2Y3NHVTaFU?usp=sharing. If you have any issues with the Google Drive, please feel free to email them directly to rye@denverstartupweek.org. 

3) FEEDBACK

We would love any feedback you have for us while the event is still fresh in mind. High points, things we could do better, or things that you’d like to see us continue to do - anything is welcome and appreciated. 

We knew that Denver Startup Week 2017 was going to be record-breaking but this week has far exceeded our expectations. We are so grateful for you and your role in making this week such an incredible experience for nearly 19,000 people!

If you have any other questions, comments or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us.

Thank you again!

Sincerely,

The Denver Startup Week Organizing Committee
