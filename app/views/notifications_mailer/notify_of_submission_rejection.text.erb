Hello!

First of all, sorry for how long it’s taken us to get this note out to you.

Thank you for submitting a session proposal for consideration for Denver Startup Week!

Unfortunately, your session "<%= @submission.title %>" has not been selected for inclusion in the <%= Date.today.year %> Denver Startup Week program.

We had an unprecedented number of high-quality session proposals this year - nearly 1000 in total. The energy and passion this community has for sharing knowledge and insight is truly awe-inspiring. However, the logistics of the week dictate that we can only select a fraction of these proposals for inclusion in the final Denver Startup Week schedule.

We rely heavily on the voting process to help us determine the sessions and topics the community is most excited to hear about. However, when assembling the final program, we take a number of other factors into account including (but not limited to) the appropriateness of the session to the themes of the week, the quality and thoughtfulness of the session proposal, the overall balance of content for the week, and the overall balance of speakers/companies represented during the week. Unfortunately, this sometimes means we do not select sessions that received a large number of votes.

But this doesn't mean we don’t want you to be a part of this incredible week!

First and foremost, we want to see you out there! Sign up and attend anything that suits your fancy. Registration opens soon, so stay tuned.

Second, we are still very much in need of passionate volunteers to help ensure the week goes off without a hitch. If you are interested, please drop us a note at volunteers@denverstartupweek.org.

Thank you again for supporting the startup community here in Denver!

Sincerely,

The Denver Startup Week Planning Committee
