Hello!

Thank you for submitting a session for consideration for Denver Startup Week!

We had an unprecedented number of high-quality submissions this year, which is tremendously exciting. Unfortunately, it also means that we could not select all of the events for inclusion in the Denver Startup Week schedule.

Your session "<%= @submission.title %>" has not been selected for inclusion in the 2015 Denver Startup Week program. But this doesn't mean we donâ€™t want you to be a part of this incredible week!

First and foremost, we want to see you out there! Sign up for and attend anything that suits your fancy. Registration will open very shortly so stay tuned. 

Second, we are still very much in need of passionate volunteers to help ensure the week goes off without a hitch. If you are interested please drop us a note at volunteers@denverstartupweek.org.

Thank you again for supporting the Denver startup community!

Sincerely,

The Denver Startup Week Planning Committee
