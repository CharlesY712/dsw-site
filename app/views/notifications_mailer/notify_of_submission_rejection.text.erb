Hey there,

Thank you for submitting your session for consideration for Denver Startup Week!

We had an unprecedented number of high-quality submissions this year, which is tremendously exciting. Unfortunately, it also means that we could not select all of the events for immediate inclusion in the Denver Startup Week schedule.

Your session "<%= @submission.title %>" has not been selected for the initial round of Denver Startup Week. But this doesn't mean you can't be a part of this incredible week!

First, just because your event didn't make the first cut doesnâ€™t mean that it still won't happen. This was the first round of events chosen for the week, and based on a number of factors, we may be reaching out for additional events to add to the schedule. Any applicable update will come out in the next few weeks.  

Second, Denver Startup Week is going to need passionate volunteers to make sure the week is as successful as possible.  If you are interested please drop us a note at volunteers@denverstartupweek.org.

Finally, the thing that makes Denver Startup Week so unique is that it is all about the community. So go to as many events as you can! Registration will open next month so be sure to stay tuned and sign up for anything that fits your fancy when the schedule is announced.

Thank you again for being such an integral part of the Denver startup community!

Sincerely,

The Denver Startup Week Planning Committee
