Hi <%= @submission.submitter.name %>,

Thanks for submitting "<%= @submission.title %>" for consideration for Denver Startup Week 2013!

We're taking submissions until June 30, and you're welcome to submit as many ideas/proposals as you want until then. At that point we'll be reviewing everything we've received, and right about July 1 we'll fire up the feedback engine for the startup community to comment and vote on the sessions they want to see in the schedule.

Sessions will be accepted on a rolling basis throughout July. We'll be in touch with you with more details as commenting and voting opens.

If you have any questions in the meantime, please hit us up on Twitter (@denstartupweek) or via e-mail (DenverStartupWeek@gmail.com).

Thanks again for volunteering to be a part of DSW 2013. This is a community event, so we couldn't do it without you!

Cheers,

The DSW Track Chairs
