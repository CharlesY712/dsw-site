Hi <%= @submission.submitter.name %>,

Thanks for submitting "<%= @submission.title %>" for consideration for Denver Startup Week <%= Date.today.year %>!

We're taking submissions until June 10, and you're welcome to submit as many ideas/proposals as you want until then. At that point we'll be reviewing everything we've received, and in mid-June we'll fire up the feedback engine for the startup community to comment and vote on the sessions they want to see in the final schedule.

Sessions will be accepted on a rolling basis throughout June and early July, and our final schedule will be released in mid-July. We'll be in touch with you with more details as commenting and voting opens.

If you have any questions in the meantime, please hit us up on Twitter (@denstartupweek) or via e-mail (info@denverstartupweek.org).

Thanks again for volunteering to be a part of Denver Startup Week. This is a community event, so we couldn't do it without you!

Cheers,

The DSW Organizing Committee
