      h6 How are the companies and industries selected?
      h6 Just like Denver Startup Week, finalists are selected “by the Community, for the Community.”  Three Finalists from each of FOUR INDUSTRY TRACKS will be selected to present on Tuesday, September 13, and Wednesday, September 14.  THE TRACKS ARE DETERMINED BY YOU; the industries with the most high-quality submissions will present in the semi-finals. The winners of each track compete head-to-head in the “Grand Showcase” for the chance to be named DSW Challenge Champion.
