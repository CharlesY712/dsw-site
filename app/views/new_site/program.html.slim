    h1 More about DSW
    h6 Innovation is everywhere. Bringing it to life takes the skills and drive of an entire team; founders, developers, product managers, designers, marketers, sales teams, and makers. Denver Startup Week is where every member of that team can come to learn, grow, and be ready to take on the next challenge. Each of our tracks is geared towards one of these roles, with workshops, keynotes, and panels that will help you grow yourself and grow your startup. And best of all, itâ€™s free to attend! You won't find a better opportunity anywhere.

    h1 Embodying Denver's Entrepreneurial Spirit
    h6 We believe entrepreneurialism is a State of Mind. It's not a process, a label, or a buzzword - it's a spirit that can be ignited, fostered, and highlighted across a variety of individual, team, and enterprise endeavors. We believe in the power of bringing together passionate, driven, interested, curious individuals who want to bring about change, innovation, and growth for themselves and the community. We value celebrating, educating, and connecting entrepreneurs, businesses, artists, advocates, technologists, makers, thought leaders, and everything in between.

    h1 Simply the Best
    h6 We receive 500+ qualified, excellent session proposals each year, and from that already-stellar group, we select only the top fraction for our schedule. Our track leads are accomplished subject matter experts who challenge themselves to source best-in-class speakers and push the envelope in creating rich experiences for a diverse audience. We have zero tolerance for those who seek to diminish, negatively disrupt, or otherwise impede the mission and ethos of DSW. In short - we will not entertain trolls, jerks, naysayers, or just plain rude people who lack respect for the generous, cooperative, supportive community that makes DSW the largest and most successful idea and networking incubator of the year.
